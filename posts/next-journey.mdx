## March 2022
I've decided to change my old blog site engine into a new engine from the old one I used gatsby js version 2 and for the new version engine, I used Next js.

Why? because Next JS offer simple feature with hybrid static & server. Which frontend tech future for using markdown file to write blog site.

When spring season comes, I'd learn about DevOps stuff such as Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, etc. I believe something about behind tech when it's published into production there are many background processes. How to deploy with each other manifest files when you are using Kubernetes. But that's not much it. There is a jam stack site, It's what tech stack architecture designs faster and easier to scale. I'll write too for deep diving about jam stack itself in the next article.

Furthermore, I've researched event-driven design messaging architecture in the world of data information. I think I'll share the detail in another article.

That's all that I've learned in the last 2 months. Last but not least this blog will be my primary source to share with you. I hope you'll find it useful and if there is any word or grammar that feel not correct. I'm so glad to hear what you thought and share it with me.
