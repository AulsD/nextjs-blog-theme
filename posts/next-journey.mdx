## March 2022
I've decided to change my old blog site engine into a new engine
which from the old one I used gatsby js version 2 and for the new version engine I used Next js.

Why? because Next JS offer simple feature with hybrid static & server. Which frontend tech future for using markdown file to write blogsite. 

When spring season comes, I'd learn about devops stuff such as kubernetes, docker, CI/CD, etc. I believe something about behind tech when it's publish into production there's many background process. How to deploy with each other manifest file when you are using kubernetes. But that's not much it. There is jamstack site, It's what tech stack architecture design more faster and easier to scale. I'll do write too for deep diving about jamstack itself in the next article.

Furthermore, I've research about event driven design messaging architecture in world of data information. I think I'll share about the detail in another article.

That's all what I've learnt in the last 2 months. Last but not least this blog will be my primary source to share to you. Hope you'll find it useful and if there is any word or grammar that feel not correct. I'm so glad to listen what you thought and share it with me.
