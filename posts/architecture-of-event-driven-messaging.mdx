## Intro
_Event Driven Messaging_ is actually a simple design pattern and many engineer out there using these to manage the flow of their data. The design pattern applied with the service oriented paradigm which enable the service consumer to stream event data within the service provider to get the notification data. 


The interaction between a service consumer and a service provider can initiated by the service consumer itself. To responds to an event that occurs within the boundary of the service consumer it should require some data from an external sources.
Event Driven Architecture allows form more flexible, sealable, contextual and responsive digital.
And as example of the event driven arch which one of them is kafka engine. 

## What is event streaming
Event streaming is the process of capturing data in the form of streams of event in real time from event sources such as databases, IoT devices or others

## Kafka event driven messaging
Kafka is a distributed event streaming that enables some applications to efficiently manage large amounts of data. It's fault-tolerant, high-scalability and easily to manage billions of events.
An event streamer apps which conclude all the data into event streaming process that handle the data continously. 

## Tools of Event Streaming
Apart from the above, one of tooling that might often we heard about event streaming is apache kafka. Apache kafka provide a quickly scale up and down with minimal downtime and also fault tolerance
