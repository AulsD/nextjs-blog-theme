## Intro
We know that when we are built an image and creating a cluster in k8s, we often use `kubectl get po`cli to check our pods if it is already running properly or not. And what if there is a terminal based UI to manage your list pods in realtime that easily to use. Yes, I tell you about the k9s, It's already published as an open-source project for monitoring the Kubernetes cluster and providing shortcut commands to interact with observed resources.

But there is an alternative to k9s and it was KDash, A simple monitoring tool for k8s cluster. The terminal UI was more simple than the k9s open source project. And it was built-in with rust programming language.

## Feature UI
here is below some ui

KDash only offers a view of the most used resources with a focus on speed and UX. The UI means to be more user-friendly and easier to navigate with contextual help everywhere and tab a system to easily switch between different resources.

for more detail about k9s dashboard you can follow this [link](https://k9scli.io/)

KDash can use a shortcut to navigate your cluster config without typing `kubectl` first. 
You can describe your resources manifest file or copy the output that you want using available shortcut key.
From navigation pane you can switch between layer selection from context info into namespace that are available to you.
Probably there is two themes (dark theme/white theme) which can be selected as your preferences.
