## Intro

Let me tell the background motivation to build this project. My first initiate FE boilerplate project was back on my job at news office as web designer. They were needed to create a fast and robust microsite every time they got a new advertiser to publish by their media online. And some other way I just need to make it DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) scheme for any request to build a microsite. 

Because I love task automation, my first curiosity was on gulp task runner which probably the best toolkit that I ever used at least now. But, instead using the gulp I do have interest on grunt that build just right before gulp was released. The grunt may seems not as fast as gulp task runner but the simplicity of gruntfile makes me so want to discover much more about this task automation. And so I end up to make that FE Boilerplate on my github repos.

## List Description
My inspiration for built this boilerplate was by reading an article of mozilla developer who create amazing css ilustration design with just only oneline css property. This was an incredible creative beyond my imagination as HTML/CSS developer before I've got into my FE stuff. But I did adding some another grunt package to make it running with js file too. 

Here is the list package that have installed on the project:
